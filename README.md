#Project 1: Predicting Heart Disease Using Machine Learning 

This notebook liiks into various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or nmot someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes 

We're going to take the following approach:
1. Problem Definition 
2. Data 
3. Evaluation
4. Features 
5. Modeling 
6. Experimentation 

## 1. Problem Definition 

In a statement, 
> Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?

## 2. Data

The original data came from the Cleavland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease

There is also a version of it available on Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci

## 3. Evaluation 

>If we can reach 95% accuracy at predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease during the proof of concept, we'll pursue the project.

## 4. Features 

This is where you'll get different information about each of the features in your data.
